Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering in Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of machine learning models. Using the Adult dataset, the objective is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. The project covers essential preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables, creating new features, and applying feature selection techniques.

Key Tasks

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Load and explore the dataset (summary statistics, missing values, data types).

Handle missing values using appropriate techniques.

Apply scaling techniques to numerical features:

Standard Scaling

Min-Max Scaling

Discuss the scenarios where each scaling technique is preferred.

2. Encoding Techniques

Apply One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables with fewer than 5 categories.

Use Label Encoding for categorical variables with more than 5 categories.

Compare and discuss the pros and cons of both encoding techniques.

3. Feature Engineering

Create at least two new meaningful features to enhance predictive performance.

Apply a transformation (e.g., log transformation) to a skewed numerical feature and justify the choice.

4. Feature Selection

Use Isolation Forest to identify and remove outliers.

Apply Predictive Power Score (PPS) to analyze relationships between features and compare with the correlation matrix.

Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, ppscore)

Jupyter Notebook for implementation and analysis

Conclusion

This project demonstrates effective data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, which are essential for improving machine learning model performance. By handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and selecting relevant features, the dataset is transformed into a well-structured format suitable for predictive modeling.
